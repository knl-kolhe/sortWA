# sortWA
Repository for my work to sort all whatsapp images into specific categories.

You can download the exe file at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n1plG2hiEagf5cs6l5CfvTchlwA9XFfc/view?usp=sharing
Additional files (Model and labels) : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wmRRwy5f2_htsZpB-3u9RNMYJ__eJzr9/view?usp=sharing


The program is simple, you accumulate a lot of junk in your day to day usage of WhatsApp. This project attempts to solve that problem, you can just select the folder where
all your whatsapp images are placed, then it will separate all the images in the folder into categories which are much more useful and you can then decide which folders to keep and which to delete.

When you run the exe, you just select the folder path, model path and label path (download sortWA.zip separately and extract alongside exe)

You can also use this project as a platform for any generalizaed classification where you just have a model and its label, then place all the images you want sorted into a folder and 
then just click sort and the program will sort everything according to the classification.
